# Resumes with HTML and CSS
I decided to create a resume from scratch using my own HTML and CSS code.
The goal of this project was to give my resume's unique and attractive look.
Lots of resume templates online are very wordy and monotone. 
I believe the use of graphic elements could be more efficient and desirable for some hiring managers.

###### Regardless, this is educational and fun to do!

I thought it would be nice to give a graphic example of my relative skillset. Many ideas I had come up with were bulky and required lots of space. I eventually decided on a "progress bar" style.
